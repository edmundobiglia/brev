## 📄 Description

**BREV** is a simple blog app I created to practice JavaScript and React.

It has a global public page with all of the published entries. The app also allows you to sign in with Google, write and publish articles. When logged-in, the menu on the upper-right corner allows you to go to the _My Articles_ section to edit, publish/unpublish or delete your articles and to the _My Profile_ section where you can edit your display name and bio, as well as sign out.

Being my first React app, it was an interesting challenge and I made mistakes, but it really helped me grasp many React concepts and also understand the importance of thinking/planning before coding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The app's core technolgies are:

- **React**, **React Router** for routing and **Redux** for state management
- **Firebase** for authentication and database
- **Draft.js** for the blog rich-text editor. Instead of choosing a rich-text editor with built-in formatting functionality, I went with Draftjs, which is not so "rich" and quite rudimentary out of the box, requiring a lot of configuration and customization. Its API proved to be pretty tricky, but it was interesting to explore it and understand how it works.
